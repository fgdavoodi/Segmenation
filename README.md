# Segmenation

Introduction

Problem statement: categorize people passing by a shopping mall into 1) mall shoppers, 2) mall staff or 3) others using visitor's 

movement data for the shopping mall neighborhood for duration of one month.

Solution: I used clustering techniques to solve the problem.  In this notebook, I segment customers into different groups. First, I 

import different features I previously created in SQL like Number_of_days,Number_of_weeks, Hour_of_stay, weekdays_showup, 

weekend_showup, early_morning_showup, late_night_showup, and .. and then process the data and categorize the customors using the 

features.
